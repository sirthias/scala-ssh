**scala-ssh** is a Scala_ library providing remote shell access via SSH.
It builds on SSHJ_ to provide the following features:

* Remote execution of one or more shell commands
* Access to ``stdin``, ``stdout``, ``stderr`` and exitcode of remote shell commands
* Authentication via password, public key or agent
* Host key verification via ``known_hosts`` file or explicit fingerprint
* Convenient configuration of remote host properties via config file, resource or directly in code
* Scala-idiomatic API

Installation
------------

The latest release is **0.7.0** and is built against Scala 2.10 and Scala 2.11.
It is available from Maven Central. If you use SBT_ you can pull in the *scala-ssh* artifacts with::

    libraryDependencies += "com.decodified" %% "scala-ssh" % "0.7.0"

SSHJ_ uses SLF4J_ for logging, so you might want to also add logback_ to your dependencies::

    libraryDependencies += "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.1.2"

Additionally, in many cases you will need the following two artifacts, which provide additional cypher and compression
support::

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.bouncycastle" % "bcprov-jdk16" % "1.46",
      "com.jcraft" % "jzlib" % "1.1.3"
    )


Usage
-----

The highest-level API element provided by *scala-ssh* is the ``SSH`` object. You use it like this::

    SSH("example.com") { client =>
      client.exec("ls -a").right.map { result =>
        println("Result:\n" + result.stdOutAsString())
      }
    }

This establishes an SSH connection to host ``example.com`` and gives you an ``SshClient`` instance that you can use
to execute one or more commands on the host.
``SSH.apply`` has a second (optional) parameter of type ``HostConfigProvider``, which is essentially a function
returning a ``HostConfig`` instance for a given hostname. A ``HostConfig`` looks like this::

    case class HostConfig(
      login: SshLogin,
      hostName: String = "",
      port: Int = 22,
      connectTimeout: Option[Int] = None,
      connectionTimeout: Option[Int] = None,
      commandTimeout: Option[Int] = None,
      enableCompression: Boolean = false,
      hostKeyVerifier: HostKeyVerifier = ...,
      sshjConfig: Config = ...
    )

It provides all the details required for properly establishing an SSH connection.
If you don't provide an explicit ``HostConfigProvider`` the default one will be used. For every hostname you pass to the
``SSH.apply`` method this default ``HostConfigProvider`` expects a file ``~/.scala-ssh/{hostname}``, which contains the
properties of a ``HostConfig`` in a simple config file format (see below for details). The ``HostResourceConfig`` object
gives you alternative ``HostConfigProvider`` implementations that read the host config from classpath resources.

If the file ``~/.scala-ssh/{hostname}`` (or the classpath resource ``{hostname}``) doesn't exist *scala-ssh* looks for
more general files (or resources) in the following way:

1. As long as the first segment of the host name (up to the first ``.``) contains one or more digits replace the
   rightmost of these with ``X`` and look for a respectively named file or resource. Repeat until no digits left.
2. Drop all characters up to (and including) the first ``.`` from the host name and look for a respectively named file
   or resource.
3. Repeat from 1. as long as there are characters left.

This means that for a host with name ``node42.tier1.example.com`` the following locations (either under
``~/.scala-ssh/`` or the classpath, depending on the ``HostConfigProvider``) are tried:

1. ``node42.tier1.example.com``
2. ``node4X.tier1.example.com``
3. ``nodeXX.tier1.example.com``
4. ``tier1.example.com``
5. ``tierX.example.com``
6. ``example.com``
7. ``com``


Host Config File Format
-----------------------

A host config file is a UTF8-encoded text file containing ``key = value`` pairs, one per line. Blank lines and lines
starting with a ``#`` character are ignored. This is an example file::

    # simple password-based config
    login-type = password
    username = bob
    password = 123
    command-timeout = 5000
    enable-compression = yes

These key are defined:

login-type
  required, can be either ``password`` or ``keyfile``

host-name
  optional, if not given the name of the config file is assumed to be the hostname

port
  optional, the default value is ``22``

username
  required

password
  required for login-type ``password``, ignored otherwise

keyfile
  optionally specifies the location of the user keyfile to use with login-type ``keyfile``,
  if not given the default files ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` and ``~/.ssh/id_dsa`` are tried, ignored for login-type ``password``,
  if the filename starts with a ``+`` the file is searched in addition to the default locations, if the filename starts
  with ``classpath:`` it is interpreted as the name of a classpath resource holding the private key

passphrase
  optionally specifies the passphrase for the keyfile, if not given the keyfile is assumed to be unencrypted,
  ignored for login-type ``password``

connect-timeout
  optionally specifies the number of milli-seconds that a connection request has to succeed in before triggering a
  timeout error, default value is 'no timeout'

connection-timeout
  optionally specifies the number of milli-seconds that an idle connection is held open before being closed due due to
  idleness, default value is 'no timeout'

command-timeout
  optionally specifies the number of milli-seconds that a pending response to an issued command is waited for before
  triggering a timeout error, default value is 'no timeout'

enable-compression
  optionally adds ``zlib`` compression to preferred compression algorithms, there is no guarantee that it will be
  successfully negotiatied, requires ``jzlib`` on the classpath (see 'installation' chapter) above, default is 'no'

fingerprint
  optionally specifies the fingerprint of the public host key to verify in standard SSH format
  (e.g. ``4b:69:6c:72:6f:79:20:77:61:73:20:68:65:72:65:21``), if not given the standard ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` or
  ``~/.ssh/known_hosts2`` files will be searched for a matching entry, fingerprint verification can be entirely disabled
  by setting ``fingerprint = any``
